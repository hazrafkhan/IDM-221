				<h2>My Story</h2>
				<p>	My name is Hazraf Khan, a typical 23-year-old guy who currently lives in University City, Philadelphia. I was actually born and raised in a small countryside village in Malaysia. I have a sister who is 4 years younger than me and she is currently studying physiotherapy at a local University in Malaysia. My parents on the other hand are both elementary school teachers. As a village kid, I used to play outside the house all the time with my friends since computers and gadgets were not yet common at that time. Our only in-house entertainment were some Japanese animation series from local television broadcasting network, which explains why I’m still fond of anime series today. We used to play tag in the paddy field, had soccer games bare-footed on a field right behind of our school. Sometimes, we even encountered wild animals, such as snakes when we were playing. I got injured quite a number of times but it was a lot of fun.</p>
				<p>	Since my dad would only buy me toys when I get excellent grade in school, I resorted to making my own toys for most of the times. I used plants and other natural resources to create my own toys or games and play them with my friends. I was probably around 10 years-old when I first started learning how to use a computer. I still remember how hard and slow it was to connect to the internet at that time. However, I learnt a lot from the net. At one point, I managed to make my own direct current engine. Eventually, I made a battery-powered toy car by the age of 11. My passion in science and mechanics when I was a kid had driven me to pursue Mechanical Engineering in college, aside from my good math and analytical skills.</p>
				<p>	I did very well during the Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia test, which was a compulsory national level exam that high school students in Malaysia sit for before graduating. My performance in the exam landed me a full scholarship to study Mechanical Engineering in the United States. Most of my friends from college went to other big schools such as Penn state and Ohio State University. I, on the other hand, was looking for a place where I can grow and gain more experience upon graduation, which explained why I had chosen to study here at Drexel University due to its co-op program. Since there was no Malaysian students here at Drexel before I came, it was quite hard for me, a village boy from Malaysia, to adapt to this new environment.</p>
				<p>	I always believe that talent is something that can be nurtured, and not something that is exclusively granted by nature. When I was 8, my father sent me to a music class. I stopped learning music after 3 months since my father couldn’t afford its high fees. Then he sent me to an art class where I learned how to paint. I first started painting using crayon and I still remember how horrible my artwork was. After six months, my painting skill improved significantly and I started learning to use watercolor after that. After some time, I started to win multiple coloring contests. Most of the times, people thought that I was talented in art. They were wrong. It was just a result of months of training, passion and dedication. I believe that no skills are unachievable as long as we have passion, determination and regular practice in order to master it.</p>
				<p>	When I was in college, I learned how to use Photoshop by myself and it turned out to be a new tool for me to express my creativity. I designed custom T-shirt for clubs and organizations and eventually made banners for big events and even weddings. From that on, I started to learn about Illustrator due to my interest in graphic design. Many people thought that I am majoring in graphic design, some of them even suggested me to change my major to arts. With a 3.9 CGPA, I think I’m doing well with my current major and should not change it. I’m taking a minor in interactive digital media because I’m also interested in website coding and really wanted to learn more about it. I also think that it is going to be a new a way for me to apply my life-long experience in arts and develop it at the same time. I believe engineering is not the only option for my future career and with many skill sets in hand, I’m open to any kind of opportunities in the future.</p>
